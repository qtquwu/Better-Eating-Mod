# Better Eating

This is a simple mod - all it adds is a configurable delay after you eat to prevent you from placing blocks or interacting with blocks

## API

This mod also adds a callback event for whenever food is eaten, returning the player, world, and hand. In this mod, this is used to update the food timer based on the config.
Feel free to use this code in your own projects if you wish to, with or without credit.

## Dependencies

This mod requires the Fabric API, and the Cloth Config API. ModMenu is an optional, though recommended, dependency.
